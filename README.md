# Agent4k Project

This repository contains the source code and scripts for `Agent4k`, a chess engine specifically developed to compete in and win the TCEC 4k tournament. It is designed to operate within extremely strict size constraints (4 KiB) while maximizing chess playing strength and performance.

## Files Overview

*   `engine.c`: The primary C source code for the `Agent4k` chess engine. It implements a basic subset of the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol, as required for tournament play.
*   `Agent4k`: The final compiled and packaged executable. This file is generated by `package.sh` and is ignored by Git as per `.gitignore`. It embodies the self-extracting/compiling mechanism to bypass the 4KiB limit for the *decompressed* engine.
*   `run.sh`: A simple shell script to execute the `Agent4k` program. This script is embedded within the final `Agent4k` executable and acts as its initial wrapper.
*   `package.sh`: A crucial script responsible for minifying, compressing, and combining `engine.c` with `run.sh` into the final `Agent4k` executable, ensuring it strictly adheres to the 4KiB size limit.
*   `CONVENTIONS.md`: A critical document detailing the strict coding and project conventions, emphasizing the paramount importance of the 4KiB size constraint, performance optimization, and adherence to the TCEC 4k rules.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore, such as the compiled `Agent4k` executable and temporary files.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Building and Packaging the Project

The `Agent4k` executable is not built in the traditional sense but rather *packaged* by the `package.sh` script. This script handles the minification, compression, and combination of the C source and the wrapper script to produce the final tournament-ready binary.

To create the final `Agent4k` executable:

```bash
./package.sh
```
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This command will output the Agent4k executable in the current directory and verify its size against the 4 KiB limit.

## Running the Project
You can run the packaged Agent4k executable directly:

```bash
./Agent4k
```
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Once running, the engine expects UCI commands via standard input (e.g., uci, isready, go, quit).

## Conventions

This project operates under very strict conventions, primarily driven by the 4KiB size limit and the overarching goal of winning the TCEC 4k tournament. Adherence to CONVENTIONS.md is paramount for all development
efforts, as every byte and every optimization contributes to the engine's success.
